Title: line clipping algorithm
conclusion :In this lab, the line clipping algorithm was implemented to determine the visible portion of a line within a defined clipping window. 
             The results showed how lines are accepted, rejected, or partially clipped based on their position relative to the window boundaries.
             The experiment demonstrated that line clipping improves rendering efficiency by displaying only the visible segments.
             Overall, the lab strengthened understanding of basic computer graphics concepts and the practical use of clipping techniques.
